                Do you have problems using our app? We created this FAQ to help you solve them.

            <h3 class="box_question">
                What is List?
            </h3>
            <p class="box_paragraph">
                We usually say list when we want to gather
                something into one place. We have 3 types of list
                in the app for now which is: Reminder,
                Countdown, Note. </p>

            <h3 class="box_question">
                What is Item?
            </h3>
            <p class="box_paragraph">
                Item is something that we put into the list. For
                example when you add a reminder list called
                “todo”, by adding an item you will actually add a
                new task inside your list which could have due
                date.
            </p>
            <h3 class="box_question">
                What is differences between
                lists?
            </h3>
            <p class="box_paragraph">
                So, we have 3 types of list.
                1-Reminder, 2-Countdown, 3-Note.
                Countdowns have counting down label that
                shows you how long does your countdown take
                to reach the due date.
                Reminders are similar to countdowns but without
                the counting down labels.
                Notes are very simple and just have the title and
                description.
            </p>
            <h3 class="box_question">
                How do I add an Item?
            </h3>
            <p class="box_paragraph">
                There are two ways to add items. You can
                either hold the list you want to add an item into
                it and select “quick add item” or just tap the add
                item or quick add item button on the right side
                of the app.
            </p>
            <h3 class="box_question">
                How can I finish/unfinished an
                item?
            </h3>
            <p class="box_paragraph">
                There are two ways to finish an item. You can
                either swipe right and select finished/unfinished
                or hold the item and select finished/unfinished.
                You then see all your finished tasks at the end
                of the list.

            <h3 class="box_question">
                What is differences between
                Finished and Unfinished?
            </h3>
            <p class="box_paragraph">
                Finished mean that your task or item is finished,
                however unfinished is the opposite of finished.

                the color of add item changes to green. You wont
                quick add an Item because we don’t know which
