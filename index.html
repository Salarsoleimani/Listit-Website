            each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated
            sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts
            displayed prior to the Data collection. Personal Data may be freely
            provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected
            automatically when using New Task. <br />
            Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by New Task is
            mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible
            for New Task to provide its services. In cases where New Task
            specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free
            not to communicate this Data without consequences to the
            availability or the functioning of the Service. Users who are
            uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to
            contact the Owner. Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools –
            by New Task or by the owners of third-party services used by New
            Task serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the
            User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present
            document and in the Cookie Policy, if available. Users are
            responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or
            shared through New Task and confirm that they have the third party's
            consent to provide the Data to the Owner.

            The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent
            unauthorized access, disclosure, modiﬁcation, or unauthorized
            destruction of the Data. The Data processing is carried out using
            computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational
            procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In
            addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to
            certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of
            Listit (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system
            administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical
            service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
            communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors
            by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested

            <p class="paragraph">
              The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of

            <li class="paragraph">
              Users have given their consent for one or more speciﬁc purposes.

              Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
              (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
              following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
              processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection
              law;
            </li>

              In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the speciﬁc
              legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
              whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
              contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
              a contract.

            Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
            transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To

            international organization governed by public international law or
            set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the
            security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br />
            If any such transfer takes place, Users can ﬁnd out more by checking
            the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner

              The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
              period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as
              long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may
              be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever
              required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or
              upon order of an authority.<br />
              Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
              Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
              rectiﬁcation and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
              after expiration of the retention period.

            New Task does not support “Do Not Track” requests. To determine
            whether any of the third-party services it uses honor the “Do Not
            Track” requests, please read their privacy policies.
